# Quiz game written in Go
I had little experience with GoLang but wanted to learn a little more so I decided to make a simple quiz app. It's a simple multiple choice but it keeps track of high scores of all the people that have played the game

## How to run
Clone the project and in the directory, run ```go build main.go``` then ```./main <filename>``` where ```filename``` is the name of the file that contains the high scores
